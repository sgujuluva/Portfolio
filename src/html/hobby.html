    <p>Gardening: <br>
        Everyone needs inspiration once in a while. After all, inspiration is the fuel to creativity and passion!. Exposure to nature and greenery is great for our health and mental wellbeing. 
        Gardening is a process, and like any process, you’ll have good and bad days, but any time spent reconnecting with nature is well worth multiple tries.

            <p>“Food brings people together on many different levels. It’s nourishment of the soul and body; it’s truly love.”
                To me, food is as much about the moment, the occasion, the location and the company as it is about the taste.
                I love to cook , invite friends and party
